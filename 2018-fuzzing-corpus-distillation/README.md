# Fuzzing Corpus Optimization - Moonwalking with Moonbeams

## Abstract

An important pre-fuzzing step is to choose which seeds you want to use in your
fuzzing campaign. Too many seeds is very bad because most seeds are pretty
similar to one another. Too few and you don't have enough diversity for the
fuzzer to explore new behaviours. In this talk we look at how to conduct
optimum corpus design and introduce two new open source tools to do this:
Moonshine and Moonbeam.
